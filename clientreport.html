        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p>So when it comes to my report on my website... It came out better then I thought it would've to be honest. I didnt ask much but the lead developer had always made sure I liked what they did with my website and liked what how they communicated with me.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="report-section">
        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p>As a lead developer I had fun. My client kinda gave me everything last minute and I had already added both other pages. I asked both my Junior Developers to add pictures or whatever the client had asked last minute. They never reached out on what they can do to help but if I asked they did so that was good!</p>
      </section>

      <section class="report-section">
        <h2>Junior Developer Report 1</h2>
        <p> I had an intresting time with the gallery project. Once again I got everythign last minute and it kinda sucked but I had already made a wireframe for my part and they told me to change it last minute. I did and it was kinda stresssful but everything got done in the glarrey project.</p>

      <section class="report-section">
        <h2>Junior Developer Report 2</h2>
        <p>So this is the one I did with Branden I think his name is and he rarley showed up to class and he also didnt make the linkn for us and he also didnt give me anything or any wireframes to do... So that was really rough to be honest with you. ou told me to put this in the report and just let you know that I realy could'nt do much when it came down to it sadly.</p>
